This is your starting repository for the COMP018 coursework for Semester 2 2024.  Initially it simply contains this readme file.   
You should work on your code for COMP6018 here and make regular commits as you are developing the work.
The deadline for completing the work is 1pm Friday Week 12 (May 3rd).
You may well have modified your UML design after the feedback from your Week 5 submission so the code here should match your final UML design submission.
